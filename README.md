This is part of my M.Tech. Thesis work. Main highlights are:
- Achieved up to 81.6% accuracy in Diabetes Prediction on Pima Indians Diabetes Database with Random Forest classifier
- Applied and analysed accuracies of “K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree and Random Forest” classification algorithms for diabetes prediction
- Achieved up to 7.04% improvement in the accuracy of Decision Tree classification algorithm for Diabetes Prediction
- Predicted missing values present in the dataset using a set of “Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest” regression algorithms
- Performed Dataset Balancing using SMOTE algorithm and then Feature Scaling
